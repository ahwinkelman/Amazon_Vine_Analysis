## Summary


There is minimal positivity bias for reviews in the vine program for this particular data set. ~2% of all 5 star reviews were paid for.  Additional analysis could be analyze different datasets of Amazon's vine program and compare the number of vendors per categories.  This dataset was a particularly broad category of electronics so due to the number of options there could be less bias. If you look at another more niche market the paid for reviews could be more positivity bias with paid reviews.
